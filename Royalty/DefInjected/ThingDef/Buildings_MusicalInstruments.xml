  <!-- EN: A complex stationary musical instrument crafted at a smithy. A musician touches a row of keys on the front of the instrument. Each key is attached to an internal mechanism which plucks one of a row of strings stretched over a wooden frame. While it permits more complex composition than the harp, its wooden construction and plucking mechanism limit its output volume and expressiveness. -->
