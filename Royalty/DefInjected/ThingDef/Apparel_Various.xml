  <!-- EN: A suit of heavy powered armor, built for maximum protection at the cost of mobility. Heavy layered plasteel-weave plates with solid ablative coatings stop all but the most well-aimed or powerful attacks. Neuro-memetic assistors prevent the suit's massive weight from immobilizing the wearer entirely, but the suit is still quite cumbersome.\n\nArmor like this is used by imperial cataphracts to break heavily fortified positions in frontal assaults when no other option is available. -->

  <!-- EN: A variant of cataphract armor with a shoulder-mounted flamebolt launcher. This armor is slightly less protective than standard cataphract armor against normal damage, but is especially flame-resistant. The flamebolt launcher has very limited ammo and must be reloaded after use.\n\nPhoenixes specialize in clearing out very confined spaces full of enemies, as in underground or shipborne operations. They can absorb hits while moving down a corridor, fill rooms with flame, and emerge from the smoke unscathed. -->

  <!-- EN: A variant of recon armor with an integrated burst rocket for short-ranged flight. Locust armor is slightly less protective than standard recon armor. Each jump consumes a burst of fuel, so the armor must be reloaded after several uses.\n\nUnlike most ultratech military units, locusts train primarily with melee weapons. They usually avoid static shootouts, preferring to jump straight into enemy fortifications and fight hand-to-hand. They do poorly in static defense or confined quarters, but excel in mixed cover or shipcracking operations. -->

While not effective at very long range, grenadiers can be surprisingly deadly in confined quarters. -->
