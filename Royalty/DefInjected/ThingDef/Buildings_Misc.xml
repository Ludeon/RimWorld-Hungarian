  <!-- EN: An ancient jade stone marked with sacred tribal carvings. Tribal psycasters can focus on these stones during meditation to increase their psyfocus gain more than a typical nature shrine.\n\nDifferent tribal cultures tell different stories about these stones, but most agree that they were crafted by an ancient world spirit during a time of great power. Since they look like natural objects to unobservant outsiders, raiders will generally ignore them. -->
