  <!-- EN: A condition that makes a person unable to walk by interfering with the motor cortex. After enough time, patients recover naturally as the brain rewires itself, but the process is slow. There is also a chance of a lucky early recovery. This illness can be completely cured with a special procedure, but the procedure requires large amounts of glitterworld medicine. -->

  <!-- EN: A slow-growing bacterial disease. The bacteria have little effect on the victim during their growing phase, but upon reaching saturation levels will induce a toxin storm that leads to immediate death.\n\nThe body's immune system will clear blood rot eventually, so the standard treatment is to use normal medicine to suppress it until that happens. Glitterworld doctors can use a massive mechanite dose to clear the infection immediately, but it is expensive. -->
